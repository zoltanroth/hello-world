# Hi there!

# I am here to progress in my career! I am learning Java and cannot wait 
# to become a developer.
# I know it will be a life long challenge to learn and expand my knowledge
# but at the moment there is nothing else I could imagine to do...

# I have got a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and so on.
# I made a plan what to learn after one I have done. I mean after Java
# will start learn Spring / Spring Boot framework, then JPA -> Hibernate 
# object relational mapping and so on...

# That's it for now and CU asap!
# Best Regards
# rothtor
